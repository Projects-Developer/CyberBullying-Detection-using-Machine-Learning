## Abstract
Cyberbullying is a pervasive issue in online social networks, causing harm to individuals and communities. This project proposes a machine learning-based approach to detect cyberbullying in online social networks. The system utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract relevant features from text data and trains a machine learning model to classify instances of cyberbullying. The proposed system aims to provide an accurate and efficient solution for detecting cyberbullying, enabling real-time monitoring and prevention.
